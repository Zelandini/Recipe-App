66,Black Coffee Barbecue Sauce,174711,Queen Dragon Mom,20,10,30,10th Sep 2009,"It's great to know folks like this sauce so much! I wish I could take credit for it but it was adopted after the original member left. Thank you, all, just the same.
I have made the recipe with regular brewed coffee but highly recommend the espresso. In a pinch use strong instant if you have nothing else. The acid of the coffee balances the sweetness of the other ingredients.","['https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/66/pic6Ysx4x.jpg', 'https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/66/picknLY3c.jpg', 'https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/66/piclB5wbq.jpg']",Lactose Free,"['1/2', '1', '1/4', '3/4', '1', '2', '2', '2', '2', '2', '2']","['brewed coffee', 'ketchup', 'red wine vinegar', 'dark brown sugar', 'onion', 'garlic cloves', 'dark molasses', 'hot dry mustard', 'Worcestershire sauce', 'cumin', 'chili powder']",772,3.9,0.5,0,2241.9,189.6,6.4,164.3,7,NA,1 1/2 cups,"['Combine all ingredients in a saucepan and simmer over low heat for 20  minutes.', 'Cool, then puree in a blender or food processor until smooth.', 'This can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks in a covered  container.']"
